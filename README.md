# Hybrid-XGboost-models
The model in this repository was used in an academic paper titled "A comparative study of the WOA-XGBoost, GWO-XGBoost, and SOA-XGBoost models for predicting rock layer subsidence in a subsea gold mine" This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing hybrid Xgboost algorithms. Additionally, the underlying xgboost models mentioned in the paper are mentioned in this repository and can be viewed on request. Prerequisites To run the code in this repository, you need:

• MATLAB (2021 or higher)
• Contact the corresponding author to obtain the xgboost toolbox (this repository does not support uploading large files, you can send it via email)
